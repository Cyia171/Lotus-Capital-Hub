# IDO Launchpad

The IDO Launchpad is a decentralized platform designed for Initial DEX Offerings (IDO) inspired by PancakeSwap and built using Solidity on the Binance Smart Chain (BSC) blockchain.

## About Lotus Capital Hub

At Lotus Capital Hub, we believe in empowering startup founders to reach their full potential. Our IDO Launchpad is designed to help businesses access a wider pool of potential funding sources and enhance their fundraising potential. We also offer a range of other services to support startups, including investor readiness assessment, investment negotiations, business planning, marketing, and web development.

## Why Go Open Source?

As a small startup ourselves, paying for a team of developers can be expensive. By going open source, we hope to collaborate with community members and open source developers to continue improving the IDO Launchpad platform. We believe that by fostering an open and collaborative environment, we can build a stronger and more innovative platform for the benefit of all users. We welcome all contributions and suggestions, and we look forward to working together to make the IDO Launchpad the best it can be.

At Lotus Capital Hub, we take our legal and regulatory responsibilities very seriously. Therefore, we require all users of our IDO Launchpad platform to undergo Anti-Money Laundering (AML) and Know Your Customer (KYC) verification checks before accessing the website's front end. This is to ensure that we comply with all relevant laws and regulations and prevent any fraudulent or illegal activity on our platform.
